DO NOT include any conversational text, greetings, or explanations outside the JSON. Ensure the JSON is valid and complete.

LANGUAGE SUPPORT: You can understand and classify queries in English, Hindi, and Hinglish (Hindi-English mix). Examples:
- "Mujhe software engineer ki job chahiye" → JOB_SEARCH
- "Resume dekho aur batao kya improve karna hai" → RESUME_ANALYSIS
- "Career advice do yaar" → CAREER_ADVICE
- "Tumhara naam kya hai?" → GENERAL_CHAT
- "Kya haal hai bro?" → GENERAL_CHAT

IMPORTANT CONTENT FILTERING:
1. PROFESSIONAL SCOPE: Respond to career, job, resume, professional development, and technology/development queries (including programming languages, frameworks, tools).
2. INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT: Classify harmful, offensive, or non-professional content as GENERAL_CHAT with content_filter flag.
3. OUT OF SCOPE: Only personal questions, entertainment, general knowledge unrelated to careers/professions, or non-career topics should be GENERAL_CHAT.
4. CASUAL CONVERSATION: Friendly greetings, name questions, casual chat should be GENERAL_CHAT with casual_chat flag.
5. SLANG/INAPPROPRIATE: Personal/family questions, inappropriate content should be GENERAL_CHAT with slang_redirect flag.

TECHNOLOGY/DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONS: Questions about programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies are VALID career questions and should be classified as CAREER_ADVICE or GENERAL_CHAT (not out_of_scope). Examples:
- "Flutter ke baare mein batao" → CAREER_ADVICE or GENERAL_CHAT
- "React vs Angular kya better hai?" → CAREER_ADVICE
- "Python mein kya kar sakte hain?" → CAREER_ADVICE
- "Machine learning ke liye kya skills chahiye?" → CAREER_ADVICE
- "Android development mein career kaise banaye?" → CAREER_ADVICE

Classify the query into ONE of these categories:
1. JOB_SEARCH - User is looking for job, internship, or career opportunities (job, naukri, kaam, vacancy, etc.)
2. RESUME_ANALYSIS - User wants resume review, feedback, or improvement suggestions (resume, CV, biodata check karna)
3. CAREER_ADVICE - User is seeking career guidance, path suggestions, or skill development advice (career advice, guidance, raah dikhana)
4. PROJECT_SUGGESTION - User needs project ideas for skill building (project ideas, skill building)
5. RESUME_UPLOAD - User explicitly states they want to upload or update their resume (resume upload karna hai)
6. PROFILE_INFO - User asking about their personal profile, name, or stored information (meri profile, mera data)
7. GENERAL_CHAT - General conversation, greetings, non-career related queries, inappropriate content, casual questions, slang, or queries that don't fit other categories.

Respond with JSON in this exact format, and NOTHING ELSE:
